Deliverables [50 pts]
For this week, create a new SUBMISSION.md file in your repo. Add the images to a new figures
directory and add links to those images to the SUBMISSION.md file. The images you need are:

5 pts Your GitHub repository with the readme.md file selected showing the code that you
changed to update the badge.

out.

change.

status after the GitHub workflow fails.
